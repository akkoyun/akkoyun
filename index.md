**Abstract**

I provide excellent electronics engineering and manufacturing services to industrial clients. I enjoy what I do, take pride in my work, and treat others the way that I want to be treated. I utilize the latest and best technology for both my customers and my own internal processes. These principles have resulted in long-term business relationships and referrals to new clients and colleagues.

## My Open Source Libraries

I also write open source libraries for AVR based microcontrollers. Please feel free to use them.

<details>
  <summary>Telit xE910 GSM Module Library</summary>

</br>
I work on GSM based iot modules more than 8 years. So i started to work on a library for most stable GSM module GE910. https://github.com/akkoyun/Telit_xE910 is a open-source library for Telit GSM modules. This module tested on GE910. And also placed on Arduino Library Manager (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

  <summary>MAX78630 Polly Phase Energy Measurement Library</summary>

</br>
I also work on 3 phase energy measurement systems. I started to use Silergy MAX78630 (MAX78630 is started with Maxim Integrated). With these module u can measure all 3 phase energy parameters. https://github.com/akkoyun/MAX78630 is developed for this module. And also placed on Arduino Library Manager (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

<details>
  <summary>Environment Sensor Library</summary>

</br>
All iot system (generaly) use a enviroment sensor for sensing T/H/P etc. So i started to combine all my sensor libraries in a library. https://github.com/akkoyun/Environment is developed for this sensors. And also placed on Arduino Library Manager (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

  <summary>MAX17055 Battery Gauge Library</summary>

</br>
Battery powered systems needs to measure instant parameters of battery. MAX17055 (Maxim) is a I2C based battery measurement IC. This library is provide to measure battery parameters. https://github.com/akkoyun/MAX17055 is usable in all arduino variants. And also placed on Arduino Library Manager (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).
