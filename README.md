## My Open Source Hardware

### B100

B100 module is an open source industrial GSM IoT module.  Module have Atmel based AtMega2560 main microcontroller and AtMega 328P FOTA (remote firmware update - Firmware Over The Air) microcontroller. B100 also have a lot of features on it in a 86x46 (mm) size.

## My Open Source Libraries

I also write open source libraries for AVR based microcontrollers. Please feel free to use them.

### Telit GE910 GSM Module Library
I work on GSM based iot modules more than 8 years. So i started to work on a library for most stable GSM module GE910. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/GE910) is a open-source library for Telit GSM modules. This module tested on GE910. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### Silergy MAX78630 3 Phase Energy Module Library 
I also work on 3 phase energy measurement systems. I started to use Silergy MAX78630 (MAX78630 is started with Maxim Integrated). With these module u can measure all 3 phase energy parameters. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/EnergyBoard) is developed for this module. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### Enviromental Sensor Library 
All iot system (generaly) use a enviroment sensor for sensing T/H/P etc. So i started to combine all my sensor libraries in a library. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/Environment) is developed for this sensors. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### MAX17055 Battery Measurement Library
Battery powered systems needs to measure instant parameters of battery. MAX17055 (Maxim) is a I2C based battery measurement IC. This library is provide to measure battery parameters. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/Battery) is usable in all arduino variants. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### Statistical Calculation Library
Some sensor measuremenst are needed to measure multiple times and want to calculate average (and other statistical parameters). This library makes calculations on stream and array based data. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/Statistical) is usable in all arduino variants. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

## Bug reports and technical discussions

-  To report a *bug* in the library or to request *a simple enhancement* go to Github Issues.

-  If you're interested in modifying or extending the library, we strongly
suggest discussing your ideas on the
[Developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/ovooelectronics)
 *before* starting to work on them.
That way you can coordinate with the Developer Team and others,
giving your work a higher chance of being integrated into the official release
