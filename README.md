### Telit GE910 GSM Module Library
I work on GSM based iot modules more than 8 years. So i started to work on a library for most stable GSM module GE910. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/GE910) is a open-source library for Telit GSM modules. This module tested on GE910. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### Silergy MAX78630 3 Phase Energy Module Library 
I also work on 3 phase energy measurement systems. I started to use Silergy MAX78630 (MAX78630 is started with Maxim Integrated). With these module u can measure all 3 phase energy parameters. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/EnergyBoard) is developed for this module. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### Enviromental Sensor Library 
All iot system (generaly) use a enviroment sensor for sensing T/H/P etc. So i started to combine all my sensor libraries in a library. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/Environment) is developed for this sensors. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### Linear Regression Calculator Library
All machine learning systems use the basic method of AI, linear regression. This library is provide a calculation of refression and correlation for an array. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/LinearRegression) is usable in all arduino variants. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).
