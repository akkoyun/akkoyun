## My Libraries

I also write open source libraries for AVR based microcontrollers. Please feel free to use them.

### Telit GE910 GSM Module Library
I work on GSM based iot modules more than 8 years. So i started to work on a library for most stable GSM module GE910. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/GE910) is a open-source library for Telit GSM modules. This module tested on GE910. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### Silergy MAX78630 3 Phase Energy Module Library 
I also work on 3 phase energy measurement systems. I started to use Silergy MAX78630 (MAX78630 is started with Maxim Integrated). With these module u can measure all 3 phase energy parameters. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/EnergyBoard) is developed for this module. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### Enviromental Sensor Library 
All iot system (generaly) use a enviroment sensor for sensing T/H/P etc. So i started to combine all my sensor libraries in a library. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/Environment) is developed for this sensors. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### Linear Regression Calculator Library
All machine learning systems use the basic method of AI, linear regression. This library is provide a calculation of refression and correlation for an array. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/LinearRegression) is usable in all arduino variants. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

### MAX17055 Battery Measurement Library
Battery powered systems needs to measure instant parameters of battery. MAX17055 (Maxim) is a I2C based battery measurement IC. This library is provide to measure battery parameters. [This library](https://github.com/akkoyun/Battery) is usable in all arduino variants. And also placed on **Arduino Library Manager** (you can use this library with all Ardunio modules).

## Bug reports and technical discussions

-  To report a *bug* in the library or to request *a simple enhancement* go to Github Issues.

-  If you're interested in modifying or extending the library, we strongly
suggest discussing your ideas on the
[Developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/ovooelectronics)
 *before* starting to work on them.
That way you can coordinate with the Developer Team and others,
giving your work a higher chance of being integrated into the official release
